# DogO - Dog Obedience Training Platform
## High-Level System Design

### Architecture Overview
- **Frontend**: React.js with TypeScript for responsive web interface
- **Backend**: Node.js/Express API server with authentication
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for structured data (users, lessons, progress)
- **Real-time**: WebSocket/Socket.io for trainer feedback
- **File Storage**: AWS S3 or similar for lesson videos/images
- **Authentication**: JWT-based auth with role-based access

### Core User Roles
1. **Dog Owners** - View lessons, record progress, receive feedback
2. **Trainers** - Create lessons, provide feedback, monitor progress
3. **Admins** - Manage users and system configuration

   - Review submitted notes and media
   - Provide personalized feedback and corrections

3. **Communication Tools**
   - Send targeted advice to specific students
   - Broadcast announcements to all students
   - Schedule and conduct virtual sessions

## Technical Requirements & Database Schema

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18+ with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, React Router
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express, TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- **Authentication**: JWT with refresh tokens
- **File Storage**: AWS S3 or Cloudinary for user uploads
- **Real-time**: Socket.io for messaging
- **Video Streaming**: YouTube embedded videos for lessons
- **Calendar Integration**: Google Calendar API for scheduling
- **API Documentation**: OpenAPI/Swagger

### Key Database Tables
```sql
Users (id, email, password_hash, role, created_at, updated_at)
Dogs (id, user_id, name, breed, age, training_level, created_at)
Categories (id, name, description, sort_order)
Lessons (id, title, description, youtube_video_id, difficulty, category_id, prerequisites, created_at)
Progress (id, user_id, lesson_id, status, notes, success_count, failure_count, session_duration, created_at)
Reviews (id, user_id, lesson_id, rating, comment, created_at)
Achievements (id, name, description, badge_url, criteria)
UserAchievements (id, user_id, achievement_id, earned_at)
Feedback (id, trainer_id, user_id, lesson_id, message, created_at)
Messages (id, sender_id, receiver_id, content, read_at, created_at)
Notifications (id, user_id, type, title, message, read_at, created_at)
```

### Security Requirements
- HTTPS enforcement
- Input validation and sanitization
- File upload restrictions and virus scanning
- Rate limiting on API endpoints
- RBAC for all sensitive operations

### Performance Requirements
- Page load times < 2 seconds
- Video streaming with adaptive bitrate
- Database queries optimized with indexes
- CDN for static assets
- Mobile-responsive design
